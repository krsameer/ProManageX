ProManageX - Simple Project Explanation
========================================

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
---------------------
ProManageX is a web-based issue tracking and project management system, similar to 
Jira or Trello. It helps teams organize their work by creating projects, tracking 
tasks (called "issues"), and moving them through different stages using a visual 
Kanban board.

Think of it like a digital sticky note board where:
- You can create different projects (like "Website Redesign" or "Mobile App")
- Each project has tasks/issues (like "Fix login bug" or "Design homepage")
- You can drag tasks between columns (To-Do → In-Progress → Review → Done)
- Team members can comment on tasks and see what everyone is working on


HOW IS IT MADE?
---------------
The project is split into two main parts:

1. BACKEND (The Brain)
   - Built with: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
   - Location: /backend folder
   - What it does:
     * Stores all data in a database (users, projects, issues, comments)
     * Handles user login and authentication
     * Provides APIs (web addresses) that the frontend can call to get/save data
     * Makes sure users can only access their own projects
   
2. FRONTEND (The Face)
   - Built with: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
   - Location: /frontend folder
   - What it does:
     * Shows the user interface (buttons, forms, Kanban board)
     * Sends requests to backend when user does something
     * Displays data received from backend in a pretty way
     * Handles drag-and-drop functionality


THE TECHNOLOGY STACK EXPLAINED
-------------------------------

Backend Technologies:
- Node.js: Runs JavaScript on the server (like PHP or Python)
- Express: Makes it easy to create web APIs
- MongoDB: Database that stores everything (like MySQL but different format)
- Mongoose: Helps talk to MongoDB database easily
- JWT: Creates secure login tokens (like a digital ID card)
- bcrypt: Encrypts passwords so they're safe

Frontend Technologies:
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Vite: Tool that helps develop and build the React app quickly
- Tailwind CSS: Makes styling easy with pre-made classes
- react-beautiful-dnd: Library for drag-and-drop functionality
- Recharts: Creates charts and graphs for analytics
- Axios: Makes HTTP requests to backend API


HOW THE APPLICATION WORKS (THE WORKFLOW)
-----------------------------------------

1. USER REGISTRATION & LOGIN
   What happens:
   - User fills registration form → Frontend sends data to Backend
   - Backend checks if email exists → Encrypts password → Saves to database
   - Backend creates JWT token → Sends back to Frontend
   - Frontend saves token in browser → User is now logged in
   
2. VIEWING PROJECTS
   What happens:
   - User opens Projects page → Frontend requests project list from Backend
   - Backend checks user's token → Finds all projects user belongs to
   - Backend sends project data → Frontend displays them as cards
   
3. CREATING A NEW ISSUE
   What happens:
   - User clicks "+" on Kanban board → Modal form opens
   - User fills details (title, priority, assignee) → Clicks "Create"
   - Frontend sends data to Backend API
   - Backend validates data → Creates new issue in database
   - Backend also creates activity log entry (for history tracking)
   - Backend sends back the new issue → Frontend adds it to the board
   
4. DRAG AND DROP (The Magic!)
   What happens:
   - User drags issue card from "To-Do" to "In-Progress"
   - react-beautiful-dnd detects the drag event
   - Frontend calculates new status and position
   - Frontend immediately sends update to Backend
   - Backend changes issue status in database → Creates activity log
   - Other users can refresh to see the change
   
5. VIEWING ANALYTICS
   What happens:
   - User clicks Analytics tab → Frontend requests analytics data
   - Backend queries database to count issues by status, priority, assignee
   - Backend calculates percentages and distributions
   - Backend sends data → Frontend uses Recharts to draw pie charts and bar graphs


THE DATA FLOW (WHAT TRIGGERS WHAT)
-----------------------------------

AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
User Action → Frontend Form → API Request → Backend Controller → 
Database Check → Password Validation → JWT Token Generation → 
Response to Frontend → Save Token → Redirect to Dashboard

PROJECT CREATION FLOW:
Click "New Project" → Modal Opens → Fill Form → Submit → 
Frontend Validation → API Call → Backend Controller → 
Create Project in DB → Add User as Owner → Return Project → 
Frontend Updates List → Show Success Message

ISSUE MANAGEMENT FLOW:
Open Issue Detail → User Adds Comment → Frontend Sends to Backend → 
Backend Saves Comment → Creates Activity Log → Returns Comment → 
Frontend Updates UI → Show New Comment

KANBAN BOARD FLOW:
Drag Issue → Drop in New Column → Calculate New Position → 
API Call to Update Status → Backend Updates Database → 
Creates Activity Entry → Returns Updated Issue → 
Frontend Updates Board → Issue Moves Smoothly


DATABASE STRUCTURE
------------------

The MongoDB database has 5 main collections (like tables):

1. Users Collection
   - Stores user accounts (name, email, encrypted password, role)
   - Used for login and authentication

2. Projects Collection
   - Stores project details (name, description, owner, members)
   - Links to users who can access it

3. Issues Collection
   - Stores all tasks/issues (title, description, status, priority)
   - Links to a project and assigned user
   - Has position number for ordering in Kanban columns

4. Comments Collection
   - Stores comments on issues
   - Links to an issue and the user who wrote it

5. Activities Collection
   - Stores history of changes (status changes, assignments, etc.)
   - Links to an issue and the user who made the change


API ENDPOINTS (HOW FRONTEND TALKS TO BACKEND)
----------------------------------------------

When frontend needs something, it sends HTTP requests to these addresses:

Authentication:
- POST /api/auth/login → Login user
- POST /api/auth/register → Create new user
- GET /api/auth/me → Get current user info

Projects:
- GET /api/projects → Get all my projects
- POST /api/projects → Create new project
- PUT /api/projects/:id → Update a project
- DELETE /api/projects/:id → Delete a project

Issues:
- GET /api/issues/project/:projectId → Get all issues in a project
- POST /api/issues → Create new issue
- PUT /api/issues/:id → Update an issue
- PATCH /api/issues/:id/status → Update just the status (for drag-drop)
- DELETE /api/issues/:id → Delete an issue

Comments:
- GET /api/comments/issue/:issueId → Get all comments on an issue
- POST /api/comments → Add new comment

Analytics:
- GET /api/analytics/:projectId → Get project statistics


SECURITY FEATURES
-----------------

1. Password Protection:
   - Passwords are encrypted with bcrypt (can't be read even if database is stolen)
   - Never sent in plain text

2. JWT Authentication:
   - Every API request must include a valid token
   - Token expires after 7 days
   - Backend verifies token before processing any request

3. Access Control:
   - Users can only see projects they're members of
   - Only project owners/admins can delete projects
   - Users can only edit their own comments

4. Input Validation:
   - Backend checks all incoming data
   - Prevents invalid or malicious data from being saved
